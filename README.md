# BCN

**Madison Landry**

This repository contains the source code for my master's thesis project, in which I investigate an abstraction of sparse neural networks called branched connection networks (BCNs) that appear in [neuromorphic hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering), particularly optics-based neuromorphic hardware, to uncover strategies to better train these networks and devices.

[Code documentation is currently hosted here](https://web.mit.edu/almonds/www/BCN/index.html).

## Running locally

<!--
Follow [these instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install PyTorch locally.

In a Python (3.8 or higher) virtual environment, run

bash
pip install -e .

## TODO

* Weight perturbation
* Add BCN method to precision, recall, etc. per label in addition to average
* Actually work on the thesis :F
