# BCN

**Madison Landry**

This repository contains the source code for my master's thesis project, in which I investigate a class of sparse neural networks called branched connection networks (BCNs) that appear in [neuromorphic hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering), particularly optics-based neuromorphic hardware, to uncover strategies to better train these networks and devices.

## Running locally

Follow [these instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install PyTorch locally; then install the requirements in `requirements.txt`.

## TODO

* ~~Investigate why accuracy = recall = precision = f1 score...~~
* Save model networks for later
* Plotting utilities
* Save results
